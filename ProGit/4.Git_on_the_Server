This chatper is about how to host git server which is of less relavant to me now.

1. remote repository is a bare repository, i.e. just the .git folder. No working directory.
2. 4 protocols to transfer git data:
    a. Local
    b. HTTP
    c. SSH
    d. Git

author did mention about advantage of hosting gitlab on own server.
